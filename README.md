# SnakeGame

The game will have a custom map size, snake quantity, fruit generators and an algorithm to make snakes move to fruits, avoid walls and avoid bodies of other snakes.

Snakes gonna have random colors and i will add some colors schemes for scenario.

The fruits will have a parameter to define if the color should be static according to scenario color scheme or random colors.

I plan to add a maze generator with a parameter to set how "closed" the maze gonna be, at minimum it's gonna be a open area with only border walls.

The game will end when theres only 1 snake alive.

Still being developed.
